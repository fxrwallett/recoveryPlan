# EMRALS

As we all understand Emrals has come to its end, it happens to most crypto projects and it's part of
the game. How we got there does not depend on the common causes of failure, in fact, the product
is functional and has an honorable meaning: to clean up the world of abandoned waste.
The problem that is killing this project is an unfair rewards system that caused the retreat of the
miners and consequently the instability of the chain. I believe in the meaning of the project and I
think it's a real shame to let it die for problems that can be solved. For this reason I propose a
solution that in my opinion could help.
Below I illustrate three steps (REBRAND, NEW COIN and MARKETING ) that I think we must
take to recover the project:

# REBRAND

## *Graphical:*

  ✔ Logo: similar but modern (colors and shadows).

  ✔ Site: fully responsive and updated with colors and shades.

  ✔ App: similar but more modern (colors and shades).


## *Technical:*

  ✔ App: adding a custodial wallet to transact directly onchain, automatic payments from the
  pool with new features.
  Automatic recognition with AI of the volume of junk posted and personalized reward based
  on this. In a first phase, users can be delegated to do this check, they will be rewarded and
  elevated to validators.

  ✔ eCan V2: great idea but too ambitious for now as it involves legal aspects (production,
  sales, billing and shipping), I'd rather focus on the app.


# NEW COIN

## *Technical specifications (swich to Pos/MN):*

  ✔ coin type: Pos/MN

  ✔ total supply: 99.999.999

  ✔ stakesplitthreshold: 300

  ✔ block time: 60 sec.

  ✔ block reward: starting from 100

  ✔ halving: implemented block reduction every 2 years

  ✔ reward distr.: 40% Pos – 50% MN – 10% dev

  ✔ MN collateral: 5000

  ✔ MN collateral halving: one time after block 500.000
  
## *SWAP to the new chain:*

  ✔ exchange ratio: 50/1 (50 old emrals =1 new emrals)

  ✔ type of swap: semi-automatic

  ✔ duration: endless

## *Tokenomics (premine: 999.999):*

  ✔ swap: 150.000

  ✔ development: 300.000

  ✔ presale: 549.999 to monetize in btc via private sale (at least 0.2btc)

  ✔ dev reward: 50% cleanup pool – 50% management costs (incentive for workers)


## MARKETING

## *Community:*

  ✔ Manager: assign an official role in order to have a single voice on all social networks
  (Twitter, Tlegram, Discord, and others). Part of the dev reward will be assigned to this
  figure.

  ✔ Community catch: let’s search among the communities of other abandoned coins, let's show
  them that we are different. There are thousands of people who can contribute to the success
  of the project.

## *Sales:*

  ✔ Public explorer: in order to advertise the project it would be useful to list on public
  explorers such as solus.cryptoscope.cc or openchains.info or others. In this way, in addition
  to receiving a technical service, users interested in other coins can find us.

  ✔ MN platforms: as for explorers.

  ✔ Youtuber: partner with a youtuber in the crypto world and sponsor some of its videos. It
  will certainly be expensive but in terms of visibility there are no better things


# CONCLUSION

It is not an easy task and there is no guarantee that things will improve but I believe it is possible
to try together. I can take care of the development of the chain and supervise the other activities, if
the project leader is interested in my help he can contact me privately as well as any of you ...
